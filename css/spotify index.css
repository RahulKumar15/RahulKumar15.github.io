      Since the iframe Spotify playlists weren't being centered, I found some CSS that will make them centered:
      https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8366957/how-to-center-an-iframe-horizontally

      Turns out you really just need to use text-align: center, or make it display: block; I also added some padding
      to the bottom for when the screen size gets smaller.

      I am also testing out making the iframes fluid / responsive using these links:
      https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/widgets/adding-widgets-to-websites/
      http://embedresponsively.com/
      https://jsfiddle.net/JMPerez/qa73L/

      To prevent massive spaces on small screens (like mobile devices), I used "height: 80vh" instead of
      "height: 100%" for the height of the iframes. See these links for details:

.spotify-center {
  position: relative;
  padding-bottom: 56.25%;

  .spotify-center iframe,
  .spotify-center object,
  .spotify-center embed {
    padding: 15px;          /* Adding space between widgets */
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 80vh;           /* Forcing a min height so the small widget player will not appear */
  }

/*  For the GitHub Section link
    These styles make the GitHub Section header appear white all the time,
    unless hovered on, in which case they turn blue. I like this style better.

    I also decided to use borders instead of underlines since the J in Jason gets cut
    off by an underline, but not by a border (which looks exactly like an underline only
    I can control it better). This resulted in a MUCH nicer looking underline!
    I used this link from Stackoverflow for this:
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9586596/control-underline-position-on-text-decoration-underline

    These links were also helpful:

/*
    This class is a fix for a bug I noticed on certain screen resolutions.
    When the width was between ~768px and ~991px (small devices) I noticed that
    the 2x2 rows were not looking right - the first row of 2 squares looked fine
    but the the next row was all messed up, one square was higher than the other.

    It turns out if 2 or 3 squares share the same height but one square doesn't,
    then the alignment is thrown off on the grid.

    This small padding increase fixes the issue by making all 4 squares the same
    height.
