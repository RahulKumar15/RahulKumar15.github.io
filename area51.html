                  <li>I'm supposed to be doing my project right now.I'd rather do this shit though! Area 51, secret U.S air Force military installation located at Groom Lake in southern nevada.It is adminstrated by Edwards Air Force Base in Southern california. The installation has been the focus of numerpus conspiracies involving extraterristial life though its only confirmed as a flight testing facility. 
                  </li>
                  <li>Secrets, Mystries of are 51! For years, there was speculation about the installation, Espicially amid growing reports of UFO sighting in the vicinity. The site become known as area 51, whic was the destinatin on maps of the Atomic Energy Comission Conspiracy theories gained support in the late 1980s,when a man allegning to have worked at the installation clamained that the government was examin recovered alien Spacecraft. In 2013 the U.S government officialy acknowledged the existance of area 51.   </li>
                  <li>What More! so, It's all started in july 1947, when Roswell  Daily Record's front-page headline screamed "RAAF Captures Flying Saucer On Ranch in Roswell Region." The U.S. military claimed the unidentified crashing object was just a weather balloon; conspiracy theorists insisted it was an alien spacecraft which was then taken from the Roswell ranch property to Area 51 for reverse-engineering. And perhaps there was a large-eyed alien "gray" inside? In September 1994, the Air Force released a report with a fuller story: The wreckage was indeed a balloon, but not an ordinary weather balloon. Instead, it was an atomic monitoring balloon meant to detect far-off nuclear testing blasts. Daily Record's front-page headline screamed "RAAF Captures Flying Saucer On Ranch in Roswell Region."

                <li>the late 1980s, when a man named Robert Lazar told a Las Vegas television station that he worked at a mysterious site called S-4 near Area 51 to reverse-engineer crashed flying saucers. This caused quite a stir, but Lazar was later found to have fabricated his employment not only on the base, but his entire background: He claims to have graduated from MIT and Caltech but actually went to neither, and he also claims to have worked for Los Alamos National Laboratory, which also turned out to be false.</li>
